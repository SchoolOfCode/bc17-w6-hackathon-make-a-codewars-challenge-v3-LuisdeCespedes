<h1>Sarcastic Scores: Turning every score into a snarky masterpiece. 🎭</h1>
</center>

## Welcome, "dear" developer!

You're about to embark on a journey to create the most sarcastic scoring function ever. Before you dive in, please ***right-click*** on this `README.md` and choose ***Preview*** mode for a better reading experience.


## 🤔 What's This All About?

You're tasked with creating a function that translates boring numerical scores (from 0 to 100) into delightfully sarcastic phrases. Why be straightforward when you can be snarky?

### 🌟 Objective

Create a function that accepts a score and returns a sarcastic string based on the input. Be prepared to handle all cases, including if the user inputs a word, a negative number, or, heaven forbid, nothing at all.

## 📜 How to Translate Scores to Sarcasm

Here's a breakdown of the score ranges and their corresponding sarcastic responses:

- **String input:** "Letters? This isn't Wordle!"
- **NaN input:** "Not a number. Is this modern art?"
- **Negative score:** "Negative score? Did you even try?"
- **Score = 0:** "Zero? Didn't write your name?"
- **Score between 1 and 19:** "At least you tried... sort of."
- **Score between 20 and 49:** "Almost there... if you're aiming low."
- **Score between 50 and 69:** "Mediocre, just mediocre."
- **Score between 70 and 99:** "Great job! For a robot."
- **Score = 100:** "100? Do you have a life?"
- **Score greater than 100:** "Overachiever much?"
- **Undefined, null, or object input:** "That doesn't even make sense!"

## 📝 Instructions

1. Open **main.js** and locate the `SarcasticScoreToString` function.
2. Implement the function so it returns the appropriate sarcastic string for each score range.
3. Don't forget to consider edge cases—people can be creative with their inputs!

## 🚨 Running the Tests

Once you think your function is as sarcastic as it can be, run the tests to make sure everything works perfectly:

```bash
npm run test
```

You should see a beautiful sea of green if you've done everything correctly.
