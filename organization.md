# üìã ORGANIZATION üìã:

After going through the materials TOM gave us on equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, and decision table testing, I decided to use equivalence partitioning for this project. I picked this method because it helps cover a wide range of possible inputs with fewer test cases, making sure we test everything thoroughly.

The table below illustrates the various categories of input values and their expected outputs based on this method:

| **Input Category**               | **Range**                         | **Expected Output**                           |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **String Input**                 | Any non-numeric string             | "Letters? This isn't Wordle!"                |
| **NaN Input**                    | `NaN`                              | "Not a number. Is this modern art?"         |
| **Negative Score**               | Less than 0                        | "Negative score? Did you even try?"         |
| **Score of 0**                   | Exactly 0                          | "Zero? Didn't write your name?"             |
| **Score Between 1 and 19**       | From 1 to 19                       | "At least you tried... sort of."            |
| **Score Between 20 and 49**      | From 20 to 49                      | "Almost there... if you're aiming low."     |
| **Score Between 50 and 69**      | From 50 to 69                      | "Mediocre, just mediocre."                  |
| **Score Between 70 and 99**      | From 70 to 99                      | "Great job! For a robot."                   |
| **Score of 100**                 | Exactly 100                        | "100? Do you have a life?"                  |
| **Score Greater than 100**       | More than 100                      | "Overachiever much?"                        |
| **Undefined Input**              | `undefined`                        | "That doesn't even make sense!"             |
| **Null Input**                   | `null`                             | "That doesn't even make sense!"             |
| **Object Input**                 | Any object                         | "That doesn't even make sense!"             |
